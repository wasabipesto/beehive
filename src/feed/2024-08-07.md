title: 2024-08-07 Nice Numbers version 3.0-ish

So I've pushed out a new version of the nice numbers project. I mostly did this to consolidate the codebase, so it's 100% rust now which is nice. The webpage (https://nicenumbers.net) is basically the same, with the charts getting data from the new backend. I basically had to wipe the database and start over, which I wasn't that sad about since I think I may have had a bug in one of the previous client versions. The new architecture allows for multiple submissions on the same field, and selects a canon submission through a consensus algorithm. Unfortunately the database is so slow even just prefilled through base 50, I have no idea why. PostgREST is very nice, it replaced over half the API code which is crazy. If your database doesn't have any private fields I highly recommend it. I need to stop rewriting this project and go do something productive.
