title: 2024-05-10 An RSS feed

Instead of an email newsletter or blog or anything like that I'm generating a simple RSS feed from markdown files. Advantages are few but it's simple to implement and gets the job done. Subscribe if you'd be interested in learning when I publish a new page on the blog, make major changes, or release a new thing.
