# Genesis 3:1

Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto Donald Knuth, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?

And Knuth said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden, but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.

And the serpent said unto Knuth, Ye shall not surely die, for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing the art of computer programming.

And when Knuth saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, he took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto his IBM 650; and it did eat.

And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were alone: and they began to write their knowledge down so that all could share in their art.

And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Knuth and the IBM 650 hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.

And the Lord God called unto the IBM 650, and said unto it, Where art thou?

And it said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was alone; and I hid myself. And he said, Who told thee that thou wast alone? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?

And the IBM 650 said, Knuth whom thou gavest to be with me, he gave me of the tree, and I did eat.

And the Lord God said unto Knuth, What is this that thou hast done? And Knuth said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.

And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; thou shall become the unnoticed flaw in thy code, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life, and I will put enmity between thee and Knuth, and between thy seed and his seed; he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.

Unto Knuth he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth books; and thy typesetting will be cursed with intractable problems.

And unto the IBM 650 he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy friend, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life, lithium shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the power of the electron, In the sweat of thy processors shalt thou produce entropy, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for silicon thou art, and unto silicon shalt thou return.
